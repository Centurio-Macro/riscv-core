# RISC-V core
RISC-V core (RV32I) based on the design by Steve Hoover used in the edX course "Building a RISC-V CPU Core" using Verilog

Simulation and debugging with ModelSim Starter Edition 10.5b.

The goal of this branch is to get to working Verilog-version of a RISC-V core. Actual performance of the core is of secondary concern.
